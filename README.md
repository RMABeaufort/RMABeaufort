## About Me ✌️

I'm a student at Western Governors University (WGU) with a passion for technology, accessibility, and inclusive innovation. My top skills include **HTML**, **C#**, and **Python**—I’m always learning and striving to grow my abilities.

## Skills 💻

- **Languages:** HTML, C#
- **Scripting/Data:** Python
- **Interests:** Accessibility, Diversity in Tech, Inclusive Design

## Writing ✍️

When I’m not coding, I write LGBTQ+ romance stories—centered on gay and sapphic themes—because representation matters and I'm quite gay myself. Write what you know. 

## Goals 1️⃣

- Expand my technical expertise
- Contribute to accessible, inclusive projects
- Use tech to empower and reach marginalized communities
